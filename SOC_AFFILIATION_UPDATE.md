# SOC Affiliation Feature Implementation

## Date: January 21, 2025

## Summary
Successfully added SOC affiliation extraction and reporting to the WOB Report Extractor application.

## Changes Made

### 1. **extractor_engine.py** - Added SOC Affiliation Extraction
- Added extraction logic in `extract_record_from_section()` method
- The extractor now looks for the following patterns in PDF reports:
  - `SOC Affiliation: [value]`
  - `Affiliation: [value]`
  - `Gang Affiliation: [value]`
  - `Group Affiliation: [value]`
- SOC affiliation is tracked in extraction statistics
- If no affiliation is found, an empty string is stored (not treated as a critical missing field)

### 2. **output_generator.py** - Updated All Three Report Types
- **Account Tracker**: Added `soc_affiliation` column
- **SOC List** (BC districts only): Added `soc_affiliation` column
- **WOB Concerns Data**: Added `soc_affiliation` column

### 3. **test_soc_affiliation.py** - Created Test Suite
- Comprehensive test script to verify SOC affiliation extraction
- Tests multiple affiliation label patterns
- Verifies presence of SOC affiliation in all generated reports
- Includes sample data generation and validation

## Implementation Details

### Extraction Logic
```python
# Extract SOC affiliation with multiple patterns
soc_affiliation_patterns = [
    r'SOC Affiliation:\s*(.+?)(?:\n|$)',
    r'Affiliation:\s*(.+?)(?:\n|$)',
    r'Gang Affiliation:\s*(.+?)(?:\n|$)',
    r'Group Affiliation:\s*(.+?)(?:\n|$)'
]
```

### Report Generation
The SOC affiliation field is now included in all three CSV report types:
1. Account Tracker - includes SOC affiliation for all records
2. SOC List - includes SOC affiliation for BC district records
3. WOB Concerns Data - includes SOC affiliation alongside concern categories

## Testing
A comprehensive test suite (`test_soc_affiliation.py`) was created to verify:
- Extraction of SOC affiliation from various label formats
- Proper handling of records without SOC affiliation
- Inclusion of SOC affiliation in all generated reports
- Data integrity and format consistency

## Usage
The SOC affiliation will be automatically extracted from PDF reports and included in the generated CSV files. No additional user action is required.

## Benefits
- Enhanced tracking of gang and group affiliations
- Better data for analysis and reporting
- Supports multiple affiliation label formats for compatibility
- Maintains backward compatibility with reports that don't include affiliation data

## Files Modified
1. `extractor_engine.py` - Added SOC affiliation extraction logic
2. `output_generator.py` - Added SOC affiliation to all report types
3. `test_soc_affiliation.py` - Created new test file for validation

## Notes
- SOC affiliation is treated as an optional field
- Empty affiliations are stored as empty strings, not null values
- The feature is backward compatible with existing PDF formats
