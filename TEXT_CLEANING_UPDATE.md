# Text Cleaning Update - PDF Formatting Character Removal

## Date: August 21, 2025

## Problem Addressed
The WOB report PDFs often use formatting characters (periods, dots, underscores, dashes) as visual separators or fill characters between field labels and values. This was causing extracted data to include these unwanted characters.

### Example of the Issue:
- Input: `"Kiera Triplett ...................."`
- Previous Output: `"Kiera Triplett ...................."`
- Desired Output: `"Kiera Triplett"`

## Solution Implemented

### New Method: `clean_extracted_text()`
A new text cleaning method has been added to the `SmartExtractor` class that:

1. **Removes trailing formatting characters:**
   - Periods (`.`)
   - Middle dots (`·`)
   - Underscores (`_`)
   - Dashes (`-`)
   - Extra spaces

2. **Removes separator sequences:**
   - Sequences of 3 or more dots/periods in the middle of text
   - Sequences of 3 or more underscores
   - Sequences of 3 or more dashes

3. **Preserves legitimate punctuation:**
   - Single periods in names (e.g., "Dr. Smith", "St. Mary's")
   - Apostrophes and other valid characters
   - Normal spacing between words

## Fields Affected
The cleaning is applied to all extracted text fields:
- **Names** (SOC names)
- **Schools** 
- **Locations**
- **SOC Affiliations**
- **Social Media Usernames**
- **URLs** (with special handling to preserve URL structure)

## Testing
A comprehensive test suite (`test_text_cleaning.py`) has been created with 22 test cases covering:
- Various formatting patterns (dots, underscores, dashes)
- Edge cases (empty strings, only formatting characters)
- Normal text preservation
- Real-world examples from actual PDFs

### Test Results:
✅ All 22 tests passed successfully

## Impact
- **Improved Data Quality:** Extracted data no longer contains PDF formatting artifacts
- **Better Downstream Processing:** Cleaner data for reports and analysis
- **Backward Compatible:** Works with all existing PDF formats
- **No Data Loss:** Only removes formatting characters, preserves all actual content

## Example Before/After

### Before:
```
Record 'Kiera Triplett .................................................................................. 5' has missing fields: location, concerns
```

### After:
```
Record 'Kiera Triplett 5' has missing fields: location, concerns
```

## Files Modified
1. `extractor_engine.py` - Added `clean_extracted_text()` method and applied to all field extractions
2. `test_text_cleaning.py` - New test file for validating the cleaning functionality

## How It Works
The cleaning process uses regular expressions to:
1. Identify and remove trailing formatting characters
2. Remove long sequences of separator characters
3. Normalize spacing
4. Preserve legitimate punctuation and formatting

## Notes
- URLs receive special handling to avoid removing dots that are part of the web address
- The cleaning is applied during extraction, not as a post-processing step
- Debug mode will log when text has been cleaned, showing before/after values
